## What is this project?
This is an interesting website. Indeed it is coupled to a database which is dynamically transcribed on the server side by the programs in php.<br>
It is therefore possible to add an article, post a comment etc.<br>br>
The project is available <a href="https://projets.thomascorcoral.com/gazette/index.php">here</a>.

## How was it realized?

This project was realized in php, css, html, sql.<br>
The basic database (texts, images etc...) was given by the pedagogical team at the beginning of the project.<br>
The css style was also imposed to test our technical abilities.

## Installation Guide

As the project is available on the internet it is not necessary to install it. However, if you want to change it, you will need to install a special working environment such as lampp.
